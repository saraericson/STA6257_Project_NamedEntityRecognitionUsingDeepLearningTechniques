<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and extracting named entities from unstructured text. NER presents challenges due to the inherent complexity and ambiguity of natural language. Still, it is essential for various NLP applications, including information retrieval, question answering, and machine translation. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated exceptional performance in NER tasks in recent years. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks to learn from data and make predictions.</p>
<p>The Transformer model, introduced in 2017, has become a fundamental architecture in modern NLP and is widely used for NER tasks. It is known for its self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of each word in the input sequence. Additionally, other deep learning architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have been successfully applied to NER.</p>
<p>In this literature review, we will explore and compare the effectiveness of RNNs and the Transformer model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recurrent-neural-networks-rnn">1.1 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</h2>
<p>A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a method of deep learning that uses sequential data or time-series data. They are often used in ordinal problems, where the output is not continues but it is discrete and ordered, and temporal problems, where data is collected over time and the order of the observations is important. These problems include speech recognition, language translation, and natural language processing (nlp). RNNs make use of training data by taking prior inputs and using them to influence current inputs and outputs. Utilizing prior inputs in this way is what creates the RNN’s memory. This is something that distinguishes RNNs from other deep learning methods. RNNs are also distinguished by the sharing of parameters across each layer in the network. A popular type of RNN architecture known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been used in named entity recognition. LSTMs have individual units in the hidden layers of a neural network, each of which has three gates. These include an input gate that controls the input information that goes into a memory cell. A forget gate that controls the amount of historical information that passes through from the previous state, and an output gate that controls the amount of information that is passed on to the next step. RNNs allow information to persist across multiple steps which enable the network to capture dependencies and context.<span class="citation" data-cites="Wu_Jiang_Xu_Zhi_Xu2018ClinicalNER">(<a href="#ref-Wu_Jiang_Xu_Zhi_Xu2018ClinicalNER" role="doc-biblioref">Yonghui Wu 2018</a>)</span> The architecture and abilities of RNNs allow it to be a useful tool in NER that has been proven to perform better than previous NER systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="transformer-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transformer-model">1.2 Transformer Model</h2>
<p>The Transformer model is a groundbreaking neural network architecture introduced in the paper “Attention Is All You Need” <span class="citation" data-cites="vaswani2017attention">(<a href="#ref-vaswani2017attention" role="doc-biblioref">Vaswani et al. 2017</a>)</span>. ​The model is designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, and is known for its ability to process input sequences in parallel rather than sequentially. This parallel processing makes the Transformer model highly efficient and scalable. One of the key innovations of the Transformer model is the self-attention mechanism. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence relative to each other when making predictions. The model uses multi-head attention, which means it can simultaneously attend to various input aspects. This ability to capture complex dependencies and relationships between words contributes to the model’s strong performance. The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and decoder, each composed of multiple layers of self-attention and feed forward neural networks. The encoder processes the input sequence while the decoder generates the output sequence. The connections between the encoder and decoder are facilitated by attention mechanisms that allow the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence as it generates the output. Given its effectiveness and efficiency in handling sequence data, the Transformer model has become the foundation for many subsequent natural language processing (NLP) models and architectures.</p>

<section id="limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">1.3 Limitations</h2>
<p><strong><em>[In progress - Pending RNN Method]</em></strong></p>
<p>Transformers are powerful neural network models commonly used in natural language processing tasks. However, they face two fundamental limitations: First, their large number of parameters results in high computational complexity, necessitating specialized hardware and substantial resources, especially for deep models with long input sequences. Second, transformers exhibit quadratic time complexity concerning input length due to the self-attention mechanism, which calculates attention scores between all token pairs. This quadratic complexity limits transformers’ ability to handle very long sequences efficiently. Researchers actively explore methods to mitigate these limitations and improve the scalability of transformers.<span class="citation" data-cites="keles2022computational">(<a href="#ref-keles2022computational" role="doc-biblioref">Keles, Wijewardena, and Hegde 2022</a>)</span></p>

<h1><strong>2 Methods</strong></h1>
<section id="rnn" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rnn">2.1 RNN</h2>
<p>A neural network has three layers. An input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. A recurrent neural network (RNN) also has three layers, but with the addition of a recurrent component that takes the output from a previous iteration and includes it in the current iteration. This is what makes RNNs useful for sequential and temporal data. Basic neural networks are optimized using back propagation which involves finding the gradient of a parameter and then using a gradient descent algorithm to find values that minimize a loss function (such as error).</p>
<p>Example of Loss function (Mean Squared Error)<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{L(𝜽)} = (1/N) * ∑(y_i - y_i^*)^2\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>Gradient Descent Algorithm<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{𝜽}_j =𝜽_j - 𝛼 (∂J(𝜽) / ∂𝜽_j)\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>N : number of vector entires with yi in output vector</p>
<p>yi : predicted value</p>
<p>yi* : actual value</p>
<p>𝛼 : learning rate</p>
<p>𝜽j : input</p>
<p>This will cause the weight parameters to be updated. When a large amount of data is used this can cause the weights to increase or decrease dramatically creating a problem known as vanishing or exploding gradients. When this occurs the weights will either be extremely close to zero or extremely large, which may be represented by a NaN value. An example when large amounts of data may be used is NER in which the context of previous words and characters is relevant. To mitigate an exploding or vanishing gradient long short-term memory (LSTM) cells may be used within the hidden layer. LSTM cells make use of three gates. An input gate, a forget gate, and an output gate. These gates use a sigmoid function which outputs a value between zero and one. Zero blocks all information and one allows all information through. The input gate determines which information is stored in the cell. The forget gate determines which information will be discarded. The output gate provides the activation for the final output. The sigmoid function is given below along with a general equation for the gates. When using LSTMs the weights and biases are the same among every iteration. This is so the RNN model can be applied to data of varying lengths.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cho2019BiomedNER">(<a href="#ref-Cho2019BiomedNER" role="doc-biblioref">Cho and Lee 2019</a>)</span></p>
<p>Sigmoid<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{f(x)} = {1/(1+e^{-x})}\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>General gate equation<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{g}_i = 𝝈(w[h_{i-1}, x_i] + b)\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>x : input</p>
<p>𝝈 : sigmoid function</p>
<p>w : weight</p>
<p>h : information of i-th iteration</p>
<p>b : bias</p>
<p>LSTMs have a cell state that is the result of the gates and a few other calculations. This state is what provides the cell with its “memory” which is very useful in NER when the memory of what was written or previously said can determine what should come next in a sentence. The other equations used besides sigmoid are shown below.</p>
<p>Possible cell state at i-th iteration<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{c}_i^*=tanh(w[h_{i-1}, x_i] + b)\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>Cell state<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{c}_i = (forget gate * c_{i-1}) + (input gate * c_i^* )\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>Output<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{h}_i = (output gate * tanh(c_i))\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>tanh<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{f(x)} = (e^x - e^{-x})/(e^x + e^{-x})\)</span><br>
</p>
<p>tanh : activation function</p>
<p>These equations determine which information is passed through the cell and the ultimate state of the cell at the present iteration. The type of RNN used in NER is many-to-many RNN. This type of RNN uses each word as an input to build the state (the context) of the model. This is what can be subsequently used in making predictions.</p>
</section>
<section id="transformer-model-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transformer-model-1">2.2 Transformer Model</h2>
<p>The Transformers model has a unique feature called the ‘attention mechanism.’ It helps the model make intelligent predictions by focusing on essential parts of the input. For example, when predicting the next word in ‘I have a pet ___,’ the attention mechanism considers the context (the word ‘pet’) to make a better guess, like ‘dog’ or ‘cat.’ It’s like the model knows which words deserve extra attention! ! Let’s look at the two most important algorithms for the attention mechanism, Scaled Dot-Product Attention formula, and the Single (Masked) Self- or Cross-Attention Head Formula <span class="citation" data-cites="phuong2022formal">(<a href="#ref-phuong2022formal" role="doc-biblioref">Phuong and Hutter 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Scaled Dot-Product Attention formula<br>
<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V\)</span><br>
</p>
<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Q: Query matrix (requests for information).</p></li>
<li><p>K: Key matrix (used to calculate relevance).</p></li>
<li><p>V: Value matrix (actual content to retrieve).</p></li>
<li><p>d_k: Dimension of the query/key vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Softmax (...): Function to normalize attention scores.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this formula, the attention mechanism allows a model to “pay attention” to specific parts of input data. The attention scores are calculated using queries (Q) and keys (K). The scores are normalized using Softmax , producing attention weights. The output is a weighted sum of value vectors (V), where the weights represent the importance of each value for each query. This mechanism is popular in tasks like machine translation to focus on relevant words.</p></li>
<li><p>The Single (Masked) Self- or Cross-Attention Head Formula <span class="math inline">\(\begin{align*}\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) &amp;= \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top + \text{Mask}}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V \\\end{align*}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Q: Query matrix (requests for information).</p></li>
<li><p>K: Key matrix (used to calculate relevance).</p></li>
<li><p>V: Value matrix (actual content to retrieve).</p></li>
<li><p>d_k: Dimension of the query/key vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Mask: Matrix to prevent attention to specific tokens (e.g., future tokens).</p></li>
<li><p>Softmax (...): Function to normalize attention scores.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this formula, the attention uses queries (Q) and keys (K) to calculate attention scores. An optional mask (Mask) is added to scores to prevent attending to specific tokens (e.g., in language modeling, future tokens are masked). Scores are normalized using Softmax, producing attention weights. The output is a weighted sum of value vectors (V), representing the importance of each value for each query. Masking is useful for sequence-to-sequence tasks and autoregressive models.</p>

<pre><code>Text: While bismuth compounds (Pepto-Bismol) decreased the number of bowel movements in those with travelers' diarrhea, they do not decrease the length of illness.[91] Anti-motility agents like loperamide are also effective at reducing the number of stools but not the duration of disease.[8] These agents should be used only if bloody diarrhea is not present.[92]

Diosmectite, a natural aluminomagnesium silicate clay, is effective in alleviating symptoms of acute diarrhea in children,[93] and also has some effects in chronic functional diarrhea, radiation-induced diarrhea, and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.[45] Another absorbent agent used for the treatment of mild diarrhea is kaopectate.

Racecadotril an antisecretory medication may be used to treat diarrhea in children and adults.[86] It has better tolerability than loperamide, as it causes less constipation and flatulence.[94]</code></pre>

<p>Using the dataframe created from the transformer model a vocabulary of words and labels was created and then converted into indices. The sequences are then padded to a maximum length and then converted to one-hot encoded vectors. A one-hot encoded vector is a binary vector in which the label is encoded as 1 and everything else that is not the label is encoded as 0. This is necessary to train the model with tensorflow and recurrent neural networks.</p>

<h1><strong>6 Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p><strong><em>[This is a working conclusion]</em></strong></p>
<p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key NLP task that involves identifying named entities in text. Deep learning techniques, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and the Transformer Model, are effective in NER Tasks. RNNs, including LSTMs, excel at processing sequences and capturing context, while the Transformer model is known for its self-attention mechanism and efficient parallel processing. Both architectures contribute to advancing NER, and the choice between them depends on the specific NLP problem. In the NLP problem in this paper it can be seen that the RNN model has a higher accuracy than the transformer model, so the RNN model would be preferred. As deep learning research progresses, we anticipate further advancements in NER performance using these techniques.</p>
